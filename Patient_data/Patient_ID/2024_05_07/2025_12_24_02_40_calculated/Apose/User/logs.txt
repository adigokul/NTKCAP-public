--> Mean reprojection error for Neck point on all frames is nan px, which roughly corresponds to nan mm. 
--> In average, nan cameras had to be excluded to reach the demanded 10 px error threshold.

--> Mean reprojection error for all points on all frames is 11.1 px, which roughly corresponds to 65.6 mm. 
Cameras were excluded if likelihood was below 0.2 and if the reprojection error was above 5 px.
In average, 0.95 cameras had to be excluded to reach these thresholds.
Camera 3 was excluded 26% of the time, Camera 1: 14%, Camera 2: 34%, and Camera 4: 21%.
